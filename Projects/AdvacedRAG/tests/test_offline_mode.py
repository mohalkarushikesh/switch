"""Offline mode: the pipeline with no LLM credentials at all.

Retrieval needs no key, so the useful half of the product still works. These
tests pin the two things that make that honest rather than merely quiet: the
answer says it is quoted rather than generated, and every LLM-backed layer
reports that it did not run.
